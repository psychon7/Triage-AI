## üöÄ Vision

Triage AI is a powerful VS Code extension that brings AI-orchestrated development directly into your workflow. It leverages a team of specialized AI agents (Architect, Programmer, Tester, and Reviewer) to transform your ideas into well-structured, architecturally sound, and security-conscious project plans.

Unlike traditional AI coding assistants, Triage AI focuses on the critical pre-implementation phase, ensuring your projects start with solid foundations before a single line of code is written.

## ‚ú® Features

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Triage AI operates in two powerful modes:

#### Basic Mode (3-Agent Model)
- **PM Agent**: Takes your idea and creates detailed feature specifications
- **Architect Agent**: Designs architectural solutions based on the specifications
- **Security Agent**: Ensures the proposed solutions are secure and robust

#### Pro Mode (9-Agent Model)
Each role expands into a three-member team for deeper collaboration:
- **PM Team**: Creator, Guide, Reviewer
- **Architect Team**: Designer, Implementer, Optimizer
- **Security Team**: Assessor, Enforcer, Auditor

### Seamless VS Code Integration

- **Command Palette Integration**: Submit problems, generate architecture, implement solutions, test and review code
- **Contextual Understanding**: Analyzes your workspace for context-aware solutions
- **Interactive UI**: Custom sidebar with progress indicators and collapsible sections
- **Diagram Generation**: Automatically creates sequence, ER, and flowcharts using Mermaid

### Intelligent Planning

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Generates detailed project plans with architecture diagrams
- **Security-First Approach**: Built-in security validation against OWASP standards
- **Code-Ready Handoff**: Plans can be directly used by AI coding assistants or human developers

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Triage AI is built on a modular architecture that combines a VS Code extension with a powerful multi-agent backend:

### Core Components

1. **VS Code Extension** (TypeScript/JavaScript)
   - Provides the user interface and command palette integration
   - Manages communication with the Triage AI engine
   - Handles file operations and workspace integration

2. **Triage AI Engine**
   - Coordinates between different AI agents
   - Manages the workflow and state of the planning process
   - Handles API communication with AI providers

3. **Agent Teams**
   - **PM Agents**: Handle requirements and feature specifications
   - **Architect Agents**: Design system architecture and components
   - **Security Agents**: Ensure security best practices and compliance

### Data Flow

1. User submits a request through the VS Code command palette
2. The extension sends the request to the Triage AI engine
3. The engine coordinates the appropriate agents to process the request
4. Agents collaborate to generate a comprehensive project plan
5. The plan is returned to the user through the VS Code interface

The extension communicates with specialized AI agents through a well-defined API, ensuring seamless integration and real-time feedback.

## üì¶ Installation

*Coming soon to VS Code Marketplace*

For development setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/psychon7/Triage-AI.git
