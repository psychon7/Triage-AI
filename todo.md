# Triage AI VS Code Extension Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Triage AI VS Code extension will integrate AI-orchestrated development directly into VS Code, leveraging specialized AI agents (Architect, Programmer, Tester, and Reviewer) to solve programming tasks. The extension will provide a seamless experience for developers to access powerful AI assistance without leaving their development environment.

The implementation will follow a phased approach, focusing on building a robust foundation, integrating the Triage AI engine, developing a user-friendly UI, comprehensive testing, and finally documentation and release.

## Architecture

The extension will consist of the following components:

1. **Extension Core**
   - Manages VS Code integration
   - Handles command registration
   - Provides UI components

2. **Triage AI Engine**
   - Adapted from the existing Triage AI Python codebase
   - Manages agent orchestration
   - Processes inputs and outputs

3. **VS Code API Integration**
   - File system operations
   - Editor interactions
   - UI rendering

4. **API Communication**
   - Secure handling of API keys
   - Rate limiting and error handling
   - Response processing
